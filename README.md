### How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I spent 4 hours in the coding test: 2 hours creating the api and 2 hours creating the user interface, I would add unit tests to the react application, a better view of the details of the device and improve the logic of some functions as well as the component separation to make the application more modular
### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
One of the most useful features is allowing rest elements anywhere within a tuple (There are some restrictions to check out), one example could be:\
**let devices: [boolean, ...string[], boolean];**
### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Yes, the method I follow is try to get information from the log files, if there's no valuable information on the logs I would try to replicate the issue in a local environment and find the cause debugging over the code
### How would you improve the APIs that you just created?
I would improve the validation schemas for the data that is passed to the API, I would add and authentication schema and I would set a response schema for the success and error responses
